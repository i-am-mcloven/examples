-d option indicates what we want the output of the compiler to be called
and may be either a directory name for class files or a .jar file name. The

-include-runtime option makes the resulting .jar file self-contained and
runnable by including the Kotlin runtime library in it. If you want to see all
available options run

$ kotlinc hello.kt -include-runtime -d hello.jar

#
# howto run
#
$ java -jar hello.jar
